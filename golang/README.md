Change app_id and app_sec words in main.go file to your key and secret.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you have your Go code saved.
Then you can run the following command to build the executable file:

```
go build
```

This will create an executable file with the same name as your main package. In this case, the executable file will be named "main".

You can then run the executable file with:

```
./main
```
Alternatively, you can also use the "go run" command to run the code without building an executable file:


```
go run main.go
```
